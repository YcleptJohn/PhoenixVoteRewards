# mcVoteShop
This project was built as a plugin for the Bukkit framework of Minecraft server(s). It's intended purpose is to offer
perks and rewards to players in exchange for vote-points that are earnt and awarded via external server-ranking websites.

This involves listening to hooks from the external sites and keeping track of points for players, and offering a visual vote-shop
that purchases can be made from, assigning permissions to users to grant the perks or rewards.
